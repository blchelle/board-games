Need to switch to nightly to run rocket

Setup:

rustup update
cargo update

In the server directory run:
rustup override set nightly

Make sure you have mongo server up.
Default server id: mongodb://localhost:27017

Not sure if the code will automatically create the db and collections.
If not, create a db called 421ServerDB with the following collections
users
scores

Create an unique index for username for both users and scores

Run:

cargo run

Paths:
Get:
/scores/<username>  -- returns the game scores of the user

Post:
/login -- login request. Json format {"username": username, "password": password}
/new_user  -- signup request. Json format {"username": username, "password": password}
